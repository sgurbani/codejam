# Google Code Jam

My solutions for the Google Code Jam coding competition, which I have competed in almost every year since 2012. I'm going to start with the most recent stuff and work my way backwards.

The programming language used varied over the years. Earlier on, I was most comfortable programming in MATLAB, but nowadays tend to prefer Python 3. I will also include some notes about my strategy (at least for the newer stuff that I remember) as to how I solved the problem, or if I didn't solve it, what types of errors I was running into.
